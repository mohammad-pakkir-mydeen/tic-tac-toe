This project brings the timeless strategy game of Tic Tac Toe to life using the power of web development. Dive into the code and explore the logic behind the game's functionality.

Game Mechanics

Two players, typically represented by "X" and "O," take turns marking empty cells on a 3x3 grid.
The objective is to achieve three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.
If the grid fills up without a winner, the game results in a tie.
Implementation Details

HTML Structure:

The foundation is laid with an HTML document that defines the basic structure of the game board.
Elements like <table> and <td> are used to create the visual representation of the grid, along with appropriate classes for styling.
CSS Styling:

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are employed to provide visual appeal and clarity to the game board.
You can customize the look and feel of the cells, including their size, background color, and font styles for "X" and "O" marks.
JavaScript Logic:

JavaScript breathes life into the game by handling user interaction and game logic.
Key aspects include:
Game State Management: Variables track the current player, game state (ongoing, win, tie), and the grid's cell values.
Cell Click Handling: Event listeners are attached to each cell, detecting when a player clicks on it.
Mark Placement: When a cell is clicked, JavaScript checks if it's empty and then updates the cell's content with the current player's mark ("X" or "O").
Win Condition Checking: After each move, the code evaluates whether the current player has achieved a winning combination by iterating through predefined winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals).
Game End Detection: If a win or tie occurs, the game state is updated, and appropriate messages or visuals are displayed (e.g., "X Wins!", "It's a Tie!").
Turn Switching: Upon a successful move or a tie, the logic switches turns to the other player.
